**Aim:** This project aims to teach the basic operation of a DC motor and various techniques for controlling motor operation. It involves constructing a brushless DC motor using supplied materials like a transistor, Hall sensor, magnets, and wires. The session includes winding a coil, assembling a rotor and stator, and building driving circuits with different components like a reed switch and Hall-effect sensor. The lab focuses on practical skills in circuit development, troubleshooting, and data interpretation, essential for undergraduate project work.
