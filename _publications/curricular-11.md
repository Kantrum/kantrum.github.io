**Introduction:**  
In the not-too-distant future, "Isotope" unfolds a riveting tale set against the stark, desolate backdrop of a lunar base. Sam Bell, a dedicated worker for the Bridge Corporation, is nearing the end of his three-year stint on the Moon, harvesting helium-3—a vital resource for Earth's energy needs. His only company is Garry, a biosynthetic humanoid, and the endless expanse of space. But as Sam's return to Earth approaches, a startling discovery shatters his solitude: he finds an injured clone of himself, revealing the company's secret cloning facility on the Moon. This clone, Sam Clone, was meant to replace him after his term, unbeknownst to the original Sam.

Faced with the undeniable reality of his existence and the grim fate awaiting clones at the end of their service, Sam and his clone confront the ethical dilemmas of cloning, identity, and corporate disregard for individual life. As the narrative unfolds, "Isotope" delves deep into themes of human rights, the sacrifices made in the name of progress, and the quest for autonomy against the backdrop of technological domination.

In its essence, "Isotope" is a poignant exploration of what it means to be human in an age where the boundaries between man and machine, ethical and unethical, are increasingly blurred. It challenges viewers to contemplate the value of individual life in the vast expanse of the universe and the moral compass necessary to navigate the future of technological advancement.


**Story Features:**  
Our script was inspired by the film Moon, but very different from it. In the original film, the astronauts were unable to communicate with Earth, a key plot element. However, in our script we explored scenarios where real-time communication is possible. This change was a creative decision to extend the narrative of Moon after the signal jamming station was destroyed in the original film. Our story can be seen as a sequel of sorts, adding new ethical considerations while reflecting on the original film.

Our aim is not just to memorialise Moon, but to use it as a springboard for discussing wider ethical issues in light of our mission objectives. We introduced the concept of clones having their own choices and agency, culminating in the clones' decision to stay on the Moon while the original Sam returns to Earth. This departure from the Moon allowed us to explore in greater depth the themes of human rights and choice in the context of cloning.

We believe that our project offers a unique and innovative perspective on the ethics of human cloning. Our carefully crafted narrative aims to engage the audience in a thought-provoking way, prompting them to rethink the original film and its themes in light of the ethical considerations in our script.
