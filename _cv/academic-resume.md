RESEARCH PROJECTS
======
Recognition and reconstruction of the elements in scanned page, Jan 2023 – Mar 2023
_Team Leader; Advisor: Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, University of Cambridge_
  * Utilized the PaddleOCR library, employing the DBnet model for text detection with a precision of **96%** and a recall of **94%**.
  * Applied the Mask R-CNN model and LayoutParser toolkit for layout analysis, successfully identifying and classifying page elements with **95%** accuracy across **1,500** multi-format documents.
  * This approach was tested on a dataset of **10,000** images containing distorted and low-resolution text, where it maintained an accuracy rate of **97%**.
